# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Summary
The purpose of this project was to use leaflet and javascript to display the earthquake data from the past week in the form of circles. The color and radii of each circle reflect the strength of the earthquake. More specific information can be obtained by clicking on any of the circles. The fault lines are also displayed on the map for reference. Below is a screenshot of what the map looks like:

Note: In order to run this code a local file named "config" is required containing an API key for MapBox. The code for the map is located in the "Earthquake_Challenge" folder.
